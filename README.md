The file called "Group_38_colabcode" contains the code used on colab to train the model and have the first report generation.

The file called "app.ipynb" is the code that generetes the site when the virtual space venv/310 is created; "helpers.ipynb", "yolo_loader.ipynb" and "pose_utils.ipynb" are the three codes that contains all the parts that app.py needs to generate the site, using also the two models that are "best.pt" and "yolov8n.pt".

The file called "Code group 38 working.zip" is a video that shows the website working, proving its efficiency.
